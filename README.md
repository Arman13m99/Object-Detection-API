# Dice Roll Detection for Settlers of Catan
This repository contains a Python-based system for detecting and analyzing dice rolls in the online game Settlers of Catan (Colonist). The project automates the process of capturing dice rolls each round, visualizes the distribution of these rolls, and predicts the probabilities of future dice outcomes based on the analyzed data.

Features
Object Detection: Utilizes advanced object detection techniques to identify dice rolls in the game.
Automation: Automatically captures and logs dice rolls every round.
Data Visualization: Analyzes and visualizes the distribution of dice rolls.
Probability Prediction: Predicts future dice outcomes based on the distribution data.
Machine Learning: Demonstrates proficiency in machine learning and data analysis.
