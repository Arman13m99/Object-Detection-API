# Dice Roll Detection for Settlers of Catan
This repository contains a Python-based system for detecting and analyzing dice rolls in the online game Settlers of Catan (Colonist). The project automates the process of capturing dice rolls each round, visualizes the distribution of these rolls, and predicts the probabilities of future dice outcomes based on the analyzed data.

## Features
Object Detection: Utilizes advanced object detection techniques to identify dice rolls in the game.
Automation: Automatically captures and logs dice rolls every round.
Data Visualization: Analyzes and visualizes the distribution of dice rolls.
Probability Prediction: Predicts future dice outcomes based on the distribution data.
Machine Learning: Demonstrates proficiency in machine learning and data analysis.
## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment

### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dice-roll-detection.git
### Navigate to the project directory:
cd dice-roll-detection
### Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

## Usage
Open the Template.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to capture dice rolls from the game.
The notebook will automatically analyze the rolls, visualize the distribution, and predict future outcomes.
